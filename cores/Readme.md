# Colors

Project built while sutdying javascript. Based on the `Modern JavaScript from the beginning` course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning).

This project consists of an input where clicking the red square goes down inside the yellow square using JavaScript and the DOM to make an animation.
